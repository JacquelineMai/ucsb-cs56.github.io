# Overview

The repo linked to contains a simple "Hello World" style webapp in Spark Java.    There quite a few detailed steps you have to get through to get this
webapp running locally. Fortunately, I've sorted through most of those, and documented them in this repo.

There are even more to get it deployed on a "platform as a service" provider such as Heroku.  We'll deal with those in the second tutorial.
In this tutorial, we just want to see if you can clone the repo, and get the code to run.  You can then make a simple change to the Java code to
see that indeed you do have a web application that is being provided by Java code.   Once you have that understanding, we can move on to more interesting
stuff.
