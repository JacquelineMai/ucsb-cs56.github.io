The repo linked to is a clone of the repo <https://github.com/tipsy/spark-basic-structure>.   

* I cloned this to <{{page.code_repo}}>
* I then added:
   * Code to set the port number from the PORT environment variable (this is needed to run on Heroku)
   * Code to the Maven `pom.xml` to make a jar with dependencies
   * A `Procfile` that tells to run that jar on startup
   * Code to deploy to Heroku using the Heroku CLI

This application is described in detail at [this page]<http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/application-structure> which you 
are encouraged to read through, while also reading through the code. 

As the introduction to that tutorial says (emphasis and bulletting added):

* You will learn how to create a basic Spark application with 
   * filters, controllers, views
   * authentication, localization, error handling, and more, 
* **[But] this is not really a full blown tutorial**
* Itâ€™s more a description of a basic structure, with certain points of the code highlighted. 
* To get the full benefit of this tutorial, please:
   * **clone the example on GitHub**, 
   * **run it**, 
   * and **play around**.

That is what I recommend that you do next.   Then, we'll start with our basic `sparkjava-01` app and add each of those things to
it, one at a time, so that you get a sense of how each of those works.
