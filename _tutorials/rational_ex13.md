# Better test case coverage

Compare the test case coverage reports from ex12 and ex13:
* [Test case coverage for ex12](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/cs56-rational-ex12/jacoco/index.html)
* [Test case coverage for ex13](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/cs56-rational-ex13/jacoco/index.html)

As you can see, we've improved the test case coverage substantially.  This lessons describes what we did to get there.
