# Better test case coverage

Take a look at the test coverage reports for ex12 and ex13
* [Test case coverage for ex12](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/cs56-rational-ex12/jacoco/index.html)
* [Test case coverage for ex13](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/cs56-rational-ex13/jacoco/index.html)

Let's discuss:
* how we can go about improving test case coverage
* why that might be a good plan
* why getting all the way to 100% might not be a good idea.
