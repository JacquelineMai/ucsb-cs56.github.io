# How to get it

* On CSIL, type `code` to access the VS Code editor.
* For your own machine, download it from here: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>

# Customizing it

You'll likely need to add some "extensions" for the programming languages that you want to use (Java, C++, etc.)

# Tips and Tricks

* Multiline Editing: (copied [from here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30039968)) On Windows, you hold Ctrl+Alt while pressing the up ↑ or down ↓ arrow keys to add cursors. On Mac and Linux, the equivalents are ⌥ Opt+⌘ Cmd+↑/↓ and Shift+Alt+↑/↓, respectively.
