One way to allow the configuration of an application to vary depending on the environment in which
it is running is to have the application look at *environment variables*.

In Unix, these can be defined at the command line, like this:

```
export DB_USER=testuser
export DB_PASSWORD=sfa8wefKH67f
```

Those values can be read from inside Java code in one of several ways.

Here are some examples:

# Example 1:


# Example 2:

# Example 3: Multiple Environment Variables
