What do you do when you get this message after doing `ant compile`?

```
compile:
    [javac] Compiling 8 source files to /Users/pconrad/github/hfj-chap15/build
    [javac] Note: /Users/pconrad/github/hfj-chap15/src/VerySimpleChatServer.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
    [javac] Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
```
