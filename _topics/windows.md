For certain kinds of programs, i.e. graphics, and especially sound, 
it may be more convenient to work directly on your Window machine rather than 
ssh'ing into CSIL.

For audio or sound programs, this is especially true.

What do you need to install on your Windows to be able to do this?

# Install git for Windows

* Download link: <https://git-scm.com/download/win>

(Note: I recommend git for windows, not "github for windows".  "git for windows" provides the "Git Bash Shell" as well as the command line git tools that we use in CMPSC 56.)

# Install the JDK

As of W20, we do not have current "tested" instructions for installing the Java 11 JDK on Windows. As/when that changes, we'll update this page.


# Install Apache Ant

As of W20, we do not have current "tested" instructions for installing Apache Ant on Windows. As/when that changes, we'll update this page.

# Install Apache Maven

As of W20, we do not have current "tested" instructions for installing Apache Maven on Windows. As/when that changes, we'll update this page.
