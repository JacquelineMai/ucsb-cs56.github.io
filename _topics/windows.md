For certain kinds of programs, i.e. graphics, and especially sound, 
it may be more convenient to work directly on your Window machine rather than 
ssh'ing into CSIL.

For audio or sound programs, this is especially true.

What do you need to install on your Windows to be able to do this?

# Install the JDK

(Note: I recommend git for windows, not "github for windows").
