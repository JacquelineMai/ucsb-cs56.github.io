* This [Stack Overflow Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4029501/how-to-convert-ant-project-to-maven-project) has at least some good information, though still leaves a lot out.
* The page [How to convert from "Ant to Maven in 5 minutes"](http://blog.sonatype.com/2009/04/how-to-convert-from-ant-to-maven-in-5-minutes/) from "Sonotype" comes up often in web searches, and is mentioned in Stack Overflow articles on the subject, but doesn't really have a lot of specifics, and in my view isn't particularly helpful to beginners.  YMMV.
