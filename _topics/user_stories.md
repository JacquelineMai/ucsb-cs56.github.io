*User Stories* are a way of expressing software requirements in terms of what a user of your software can do.

They often take the form: 

* As a (some role) I can (perform some function in the software) so that (I can acheive some goal I have).

As an example, some user stories for an email program might be:

* As a user, I can start a new email so that I can communicate with other email users.
* As a user, I can add a recipient to my email using an autocomplete function so that I can find recipients more easily.
* As a user, I can delete an unsent email so that I can change my mind about sending an email.
