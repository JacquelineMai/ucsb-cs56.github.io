# What is Postgres

There are many SQL based database systems.   *Postgres* is one particular implementation (MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle, being three others, with H2 being a commonly used
"in memory" only database.)

# Why use Postgres?

The main reason we prefer Postgres in CMPSC 56 is that it comes for free with the free tier of Heroku, and is automatically provisioned.

No other database system comes in the free tier and is so easy to provision.
