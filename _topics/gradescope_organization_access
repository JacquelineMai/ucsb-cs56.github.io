This page is mostly for instructors and staff that are trying to debug why students are not not able to find their repos 
in the drop down menu on Gradescope for submission directly from GitHub.

This page may be of some help: 
* <https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/requesting-organization-approval-for-oauth-apps>

There is some flow by which someone has to request third party access to Gradescope to the course organization, e.g ucsb-cs56-w20, and then 
an owner of the organization has to approve that access.

We've seen it work before, a few times, but we've never taken the time to document how to make it work.  This time we are going to try
to actually write down if we see it working.
