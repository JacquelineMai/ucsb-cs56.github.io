Slack ([slack.com](https://slack.com)) is a chat-based communication tool for teams.  It is widely used in the software development industry.

In this course, we are trying to mirror real-world practice where practical, so we'll be using Slack rather than tools that are more oriented towards 
academic courses (e.g. Piazza.)
