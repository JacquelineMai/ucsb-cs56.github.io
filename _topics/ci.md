Continuous Integration (CI) is an industry standard practice for professional software development.

Some commonly used CI systems include:
* Jenkins
* Travis-CI

# Travis-CI

You can use Travis-CI for free on pretty much any open source github.com repo that has a `.travis.yml` file in it.

You log into <http://travis-ci.org> with your github.com username/password in order to set it up.
