[Heroku](https://heroku.com) is a "platform as a service" (PAAS) cloud-computing platform.

At least as of this writing (August 2018), Heroku has a free tier that we can use without needing a credit card
to try out Java applications (including web applications) in the cloud.  This allows us to run Java web applications and make them 
available 24x7 on the public internet.
