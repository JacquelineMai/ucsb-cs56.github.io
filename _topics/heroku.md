[Heroku](https://heroku.com) is a "platform as a service" (PAAS) cloud-computing platform.

At least as of this writing (August 2018), Heroku has a free tier that we can use without needing a credit card
to try out Java applications (including web applications) in the cloud.  This allows us to run Java web applications and make them 
available 24x7 on the public internet.



# The Heroku Toolbelt (aka Heroku CLI)

The "Heroku Toolbelt" is a command-line interface to Heroku that you can install on Windows, Mac or Linux.

Installing this on CSIL, officially, is a bit of a problem, since, regrettably, Heroku does not make a regular "yum" style install for Fedora systems available.     (The ECI staff for various reasons are not in a position to officially support software that is not distributed in that usual standard fashion.)

Below, I'm going to describe a way of installing the Heroku Toolbelt that "might" work for us.   We'll see.

If not, we'll try to work around that by either:
* doing everything through the Heroku web page interface, and/or
* using the Heroku toolbelt on our our laptops, where possible.
