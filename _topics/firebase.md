# Tutorials

* <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/firebase/>

# Getting Started

* Go to <https://firebase.com> and login with your Google Credentials.
* Create an app, and accept the terms.
* That will put you at the Firebase Console
* You'll see buttons for iOS, Android, and one that looks like this: `</>`.  
   That last one means "webapp".
   If you click it, you'll be shown some JavaScript code you can include in your app.
   BUT BEWARE!  This JavaScript code contains your API Key.  You might not want that to end up
   on Github.
