This article describes a more advanced workflow than the [Git: Basic Workflow](/topics/git_basic_workflow/) where all work is done on the master branch.

You should be completely comfortable with the [Git: Basic Workflow](/topics/git_basic_workflow/) before diving into this more advanced topic.

# A workflow based on feature branches

In most "real-world" uses of git/github (e.g. at software companies), rather than working on the `master` branch being the common case,
it is far more often the case that you *never, ever, ever work directly on master!!!*

Instead, each time you start a new story, issue, feature or bug fix, you start by creating a "feature branch" as an alternative to the `master` branch.

When you are finished with the story, feature, bug fix, etc. you would do a pull request from the feature branch
to the `master` branch.  This could be a pull request within the same repository, or it could be a pull request from one fork of a repo to another.

# Using this workflow on legacy code projects

You will use this branch method to avoid accidentally making changes to pending/open pull requests while working on other issues. That might happen when you do all your work on master because pull requests don't use a snapshot of the code from the time that you made the pull request; instead, they point to the branch you are trying to pull from. This means if you push more changes to a branch after making a pull request from that branch, these changes will be reflected in the pull request immediately. And the goal here is to submit each issue you resolve in a separate pull request.

Ideally, you will **never have a pull request open from your master branch**. Instead, each pull request will be from a feature branch. That way, you can merge your feature branches into your own fork's master branch (once you are ready to integrate those changes into your application) at your leisure and it won't mess up your other pull requests (to merge a branch into your master branch, make sure you are on master and then call `git merge BRANCH_NAME`, but only do this on your fork).

This will also show you how many teams develop software **in the real world**. In these environments, you **never, ever, ever** make changes directly to the master branch. Master is for **production-ready code**. Devvelopment teams use branches to keep in-development projects/pieces separate.

# How to

When beginning work on an issue, you should start clean from the master version. `git status` will tell you which branch you are on. If you are not on master, switch to master with `git checkout master` (your changes on the other branch will not be lost; they will still be there if you `git checkout` back to that branch). Make sure you are up-to-date by calling `git pull`, then create a new branch with `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`.

```
$ git checkout -b feature/text-color
Switched to a new branch 'feature/text-color'
$
```

The `-b` means to create a new branch; if you are switching to an existing branch, you can just leave off the `-b`. 

Moving forward, you will use:

* `git push origin feature/text-color` rather than `git push origin master`
* `git pull origin feature/text-color` rather than `git pull origin master`

Branch naming conventions vary slightly, but one way is to preface feature branches with "feature/" and bug-fixing branches with "hotfix/". For example, `feature/text-color` or `hotfix/empty-list-crash`.

After you've committed all your changes on this feature branch, push it, and then open a new pull request to the UCSB-CS56-Projects repo from the branch you were working on and include the issue in the pull request description.
