MongoDB is a particular implementation of a technology known as NoSQL databases.

The basic idea is that you can store JSON objects in the cloud.   Everything else is just sort of a riff on that theme.

This article is a stub, a placeholder for more information about MongoDB that may be of interest to CS56 students.

If you have suggestions for links, articles, information, demos etc. that should appear here, either post to Piazza, or better yet, 
fork this repo, add them, and do a pull request.

There is already a LOT of info about MongoDB at this other website: <http://pconrad-webapps.github.io/topics/mongodb/>
* In particular, this page about Java stuff: <http://pconrad-webapps.github.io/topics/mongodb_java/>
* It also discusses how to get started with [MLab](http://pconrad-webapps.github.io/topics/mongodb_mlab/) which is a particular provider of MongoDB (e.g. Mlab is to MongoDB like github is to git)
