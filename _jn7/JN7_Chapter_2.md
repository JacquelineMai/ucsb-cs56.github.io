The big picture
---------------

This chapter is a complete overview of Java Syntax.

It's a very long chapter (83 pages), so it probably isn't a
good idea to try to read it in one sitting.

We'll parcel it out a bit at a time, and mostly use this as reference
when we need to examine something that differs significantly
from C++.
